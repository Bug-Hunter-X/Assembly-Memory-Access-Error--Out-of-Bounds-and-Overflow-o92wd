The solution involves adding checks to ensure that all values involved in the address calculation are within valid ranges.  This might involve comparing `ebx` and `ecx` against allowed limits before performing the memory access.  Additionally, the calculation should be done carefully to avoid integer overflow.

Example (Illustrative - specific implementation depends on the context and architecture):

```assembly
; Check for valid range of ebx and ecx
mov eax, ebx
cmp eax, valid_ebx_max ; Assuming valid_ebx_max is defined elsewhere
jae out_of_bounds_ebx

mov eax, ecx
cmp eax, valid_ecx_max ; Assuming valid_ecx_max is defined elsewhere
jae out_of_bounds_ecx

; Perform calculation to prevent overflow (method may vary depending on the architecture) 
mov eax, ecx
imul eax, 4       ; ecx * 4
add eax, ebx       ; eax = ecx * 4 + ebx
add eax, 0x10      ; eax = ecx * 4 + ebx + 0x10
jc overflow       ; jump to overflow handling if carry flag is set

mov edx, [eax] ; Safe memory access
jmp done

out_of_bounds_ebx:
; Handle out of bounds error
jmp error
out_of_bounds_ecx:
;Handle out of bounds error
jmp error
overflow:
; Handle integer overflow
jmp error
done:
; Continue program execution
error:
; Error handling
```
This improved code includes checks for valid ranges and handling for potential overflow, significantly reducing the risk of memory access errors.
